- 👋 I’m @wmpowell8 aka William Powell.
- 👀 I am an independent beginner programmer who just likes to work on my own projects. I hope to use GitHub to share my code with others.
- 💞️ I am writing this just after creating my account, so this should be obvious, but if you're looking to contribute to any of my projects, just submit a pull request!
- 📫 How to reach me: My Discord tag is wmpowell8#6150
